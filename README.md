# üå¨Ô∏è Airflow

## About this Project

This project uses [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) to get the [Wordnik API](https://developer.wordnik.com/) word of the day (and its definition) and saves it to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Inspiration

Airflow is becoming more popular, so I wanted to do a small project to make sure I was familiar with its main components and features.

## Installation & Usage

In your terminal/ command line, make sure you have Python 3 installed (I'm using Python 3.6.8):
<br>
    `$ python3 --version`

Libraries Used:

- [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/python-api-ref.html)
- [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

After downloading this repository, read [running Airflow locally](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/local.html) to learn more about spinning it up locally.
